Feature: Be able to generate components quickly
  In order to think about long term development
  As a developer
  I want to be able to quickly generate components
  Scenario: Developing components for tests

  Example: Given that I want to develop an isotope component
    Given that all elements have the hourglass
    When I want to quickly create an isotope component
    Then I can quickly retrieve elements

  Example: developing for long term libraries, like owl, isotope for all sorts of things
  Scenario: Developing inputs

  Scenario: Developing hourglass for everything (e.g., list items)

  Example: Given that I want to select the second item in this class, but select it's sibling or parent

  Scenario: Selecting the nth element based on a data attribute

  Scenario: Select the first element with this class within this div

  Scenario: Selecting the inner element of a div (that has the data attribute)
