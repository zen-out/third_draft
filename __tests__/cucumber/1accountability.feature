Feature: Make sure you finish your shit

  Scenario: User logged a problem and created cheatsheet, but is not working on it

    Given that the whole purpose of the application is to have it be social
    And the user wants it to work
    When they first sign up, there should be a whole section of the app explaining to them how the application works and why its important to at least put a number (or perhaps a messenger friend) for accountability purposes
    And if it doesnt work, who cares, they can always turn off the notification
    Then they will feel good about at least attempting to try to use this application properly
    And begin to get shit done
    And feel good about themselves

  Scenario: User Flow (handlebars jquery axios)

    Given the user has added a problem
    And they want to keep themselves accountable
    And they have entered an email
    Then a notification will be created, and they can turn these off on their settings page
    And this notification will be sent to at least one close friend and themselves
    And with the header, hey, can you keep me accountable for this?
