Feature: Me having independence

  Scenario: The app is a failure

    If the app sucks
    Given that Ive tried my best, wrote out tests, followed protocols and just made everything very step by step
    And I feel like I want to give up
    When I want to give up
    And I perhaps fucked up the application beyond measure
    Then I could look at past commits, or at least past modules
    And figure out what went wrong
    And figure out what could go better


  Scenario: User Flow (handlebars jquery axios)

    If no one registers
    Given that Ive tried and marketed it and spoken to a lot of different people and published it on ten different websites
    And its not gaining any traction
    And
    Then at least I would have learned something - webpack, babel and cucumber, because I would have at least logged those problems in my problem soving application
    And I can go back to my office and quickly get a move on to the next problem i feel strongly about solving
    And i imagine my life to be like gaudis
