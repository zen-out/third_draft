Feature: Focus on what you are currently doing, and time it

  Scenario: User has a lot of tabs open and wants to get something done but has fallen into a rabbit hole (which happens to us all doesnt it)

    Given that the user has started a task
    And they want to complete it
    When they start a task
    And they turn on "intense" mode
    Then the whole screen will go blank
    And they will close all the tabs
    And request that the user really focus, just for 25 minutes

  Scenario: User Flow (handlebars jquery axios)

    If they have started a task
    Given that its an intense mode
    And they want to really focus
    And want to get shit done
    Then the modal will be super dark
    And the only thing that will be blinking is the timer
    And they will be a fucking baller
    And they will feel good about the time they have spent on that particular feature
