Feature: Life As Art

  User should be able to utilize this tool to feel good about the projects they have made

  Scenario: Feeling shitty

    If the client feels bad or demotivated about their current life plan
    Given that they are a registered customer, or at least have one project
    And they have one friend who knows about their project
    When they havent logged in for a while
    And they have at least one problem, task and cheatsheet
    Then we will send an email out to their friend and them reminding them that they are good because theyve tried making something to solve problems and thats what life is all about
    And they should come back
    And they should also become a subscriber so they can continue to make cool shit

  Scenario: User Flow (handlebars jquery axios)

    Given that the user has just signed up
    And they have verified their email
    And they want to quickly go through a tutorial
    Then there will be a fun interactive section about the importance of keeping themselves accountable
    And they will fill in at least one email
    And they will fill in at least one problem
    And perhaps even start on one task


  Scenario: Database

    Given that the user has signed in, fetch user information
    And if they have not gone through a tutorial
    Then a notification will pop up saying hey brah wanna go through a tutorial?
    And if they dont, then they can just get started by posting a form
    And

  Scenario: /introduction

    Given the user has reached the dashboard route
    And they are logged in via checking sessions or cookies
    And they have not gone through the tutorial yet (we can check this by introduction database)
    Then there will be an introduction section
    And the introduction will just probably be a photo gallery
    And at the end of the gallery they will be encouraged to post a problem
    And a friends email
