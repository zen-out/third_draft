Feature: Its okay if you didnt solve it

  Scenario: User is unable to solve a problem and its past the deadline

    If the user has been working on something for a while
    Given that they really want to solve this problem
    And they have completed every step
    When they still havent solved it
    And the emails have been sent
    Then we could ask them to think about their problem differently. This could be a way to inspire / instigate people to see themselves differently. How is this not a problem? How is this more about (excuse the cliche), the journey instead?
    And how can they get out of their head so they dont feel so discouraged?
    And how do we ensure that they feel motivated to do so?
    And perhaps emails will be sent out to friends, reminding them to send encouraging messages to their friend


  Scenario: User Flow (handlebars jquery axios)

    If the problem has started
    Given that the deadline has not yet been reached
    And they havent logged any tasks
    Then a gentle modal will pop up, perhaps a rubber duck, asking them what they need to do to get a move on
    And we are not judging here, just observing
    And we dont want to forget the purpose of this entire thing, which essentially is my entire life.
