Feature: Theme to Inspire Your Day

  Inspired by my LSD trip, this feature is essentially to show that all human beings are really quite similar, though we do vary physically, mentally and spiritually. Given the right triggers, however, we may be able to actually encourage some of our forgotten personality aspects.

  Scenario: Feeling quite rigid

    If the user has been using the same theme for quite some time
    Given that they havent explored other themes
    And that they havent used different themes with different pages
    When they log a problem, or when they start a timer
    Then there will be a dropdown or button encouraging them to choose a different theme
    And hopefully itll get them to see their problem differently
    And or at least be able to feel good about doing something new


  Scenario: User Flow (handlebars jquery axios)

    Given that they have a theme chosen (lets figure out how to do this)
    And they want to try out a more dynamic outlook
    And they want to just be whatever
    Then the page will just give them a different theme
    And this will be fetched through class names, probably
    And perhaps they can toggle the theme through a select dropdown

  Scenario: Database

    Given that they are logged in
    And they have a current theme on
    Then there will be a trigger to send toast to the user, perhaps reminding them that they can check out different themes
    And if they accept, the database may log that information
    And perhaps there will be a feedback form as to whether or not they liked the theme
    And perhaps they can even customize their own theme like vscode does here

  Scenario: Route

    Given they are on the dashboard route
    And they want to add a problem
    And perhaps change the way they see the problem
    Then
    And
    And

  Scenario: Edge Case

    If
    Given
    And
    And
    Then
    And
    And



  Scenario: Just not on point at all

    If
    Given
    And
    And
    Then
    And
    And
